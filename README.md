# Comment Free Zone by Progress Planner

A plugin to fully remove comments, trackbacks and all related features from your WordPress site.

This plugin will:

* In the admin:
    * Remove the comments menu
    * Remove the discussion settings page
    * Remove the comments column from posts and pages
    * Remove the comment section from the admin bar
* On the front-end:
    * Disable comments on all post types
    * Disable pingbacks and trackbacks
    * Remove comment support from all post types
    * Remove the output of all the comment blocks from the Gutenberg and site editor
    * Remove the comment meta box from the post edit screen
    * Remove the comment RSS feeds

Once activated, this plugin requires no configuration - it just works. If you want to _completely_ remove comments from your WordPress site, this is the plugin for you.
